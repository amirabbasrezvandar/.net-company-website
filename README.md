Project Overview

This is a corporate website project built with ASP.NET MVC for the backend and Bootstrap for the frontend.

A 2-minute preview video is included to demonstrate the main features and overall functionality of the website.

The website is designed to be fully manageable through an admin panel, where all content—such as texts, images, and data—can be customized and updated easily without modifying the code.

Unfortunately, due to certain circumstances, this project was left unfinished .
